<h1> About Me! </h1>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p> Hey! Whenever anybody asks about me, I never know what to say. There's just so much, yet there's so little. So here it goes. I'm Yu Jing Chen and I'm currently a sophomore! I love being with people and having a good laugh. I'm always ready for a good pun or a cringe-worthy math or science pickup line. Those are the best ones:) Speaking of, if you were a circle, your circumference would be QTÏ€. That one is copyrighted by me. If you didn't enjoy it, I must ask you kindly to leave my page. Just kidding! Please stay. I have a great page of memes I would like to share. Anyway, I also believe in living life to the fullest and I'm hardly found sitting and doing nothing, although that is also very enjoyable!</p>
